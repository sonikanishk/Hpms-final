                        Saving time is the first step in saving lives. Air Ambulance Services are used when ground transport could endanger a patient's life. They are also indispensable when the patient is in a remote area and time is critical. We are equipping each of our hospitals with emergency air ambulance services. The Kolkata hospital has a roof helipad. Our Delhi and Hyderabad hospitals have landing facilities.
                        <br/>
                        Both fixed wing aircrafts and helicopters provide the services. Aviation companies take care of the aviation logistics. Medical aspects like trained personnel, equipment and care are provided by the 1066 emergency services. HPMS's Air Ambulance services conquer time and distance in emergencies and saves lives.
